# 🎲 Perudo Roguelike (Prototype)

A minimalist prototype inspired by **Perudo (Liar's Dice)** — rebuilt as a turn-based bluffing game using **Lua** and **Love2D**.

This is a stripped-down version of the classic ruleset: roll hidden dice, bluff your way through turns, and try not to get caught lying.
